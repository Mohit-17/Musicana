# Musicana
This Website allows users to select their favorite artists and view their songs. Also, I used a Popularity based algorithm and a Similarity-based algorithm to recommend songs 
to the users(Used the Kaggle Dataset due to the lack of users on my platform).

Requirements
1. Client ID through Google Developer Console for using Google OAuth 2.0 Consent Screen.
2. MongoDB account required for Database operations. Username, password and database_name will be required.
3. Latest version of Node.Js 

Steps for implementing this project
1. Paste your username, password, and database_name in keys.js file present in config folder of main directory. 
2. Run npm install to install all the dependencies present in package.json file
3. Run nodemon app.js to start the server file, now you can view the website at https://localhost:3000
